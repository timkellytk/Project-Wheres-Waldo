# React Where's Waldo Game

> From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/where-s-waldo-a-photo-tagging-app-javascript)

To play the game, choose a level, find all the characters and save your name on the global leaderboard. The game gives the player real-time updates for every character selection. The global leaderboard is child-friendly with a cloud function to censor rude words in usernames.
